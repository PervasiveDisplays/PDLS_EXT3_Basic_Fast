///
/// @details The Pervasive Displays Library Suite is specifically designed for the Pervasive Displays e-paper screens and EXT3 extension board. 
///
/// It provides a high-level interface to drive the e-paper screens with global, fast and partial update, supports capacitive touch and haptic feed-back.

/// @section Structure Library structure
/// @details The highView Library Suite contains three layers:
/// * top level end-user libraries like GUI.h with label, button, dialog, menu or slider with, and Graphics.h with graphics.
/// * intermediate level screen-specific libraries, ie. ePaper_EXT3_Basic_Library.h
/// * low level virtual classes, ie. hV_Screen_Buffer or hV_Font_Terminal.h
///
/// @section Version Version management
/// @brief This section details the management and control of each library part of the Serial_LCD Library Suite.
/// @details Each library has a release number to be checked at pre-processing.
///
/// Each library has its own release number.
/// @code {.cpp}
/// #define hV_FONT_RELEASE 105
/// @endcode
///
/// The release number is checked at pre-processing
/// @code {.cpp}
/// #include "hV_Screen_Font.h"
///
/// #if (hV_FONT_RELEASE < 106)
/// #error Required hV_FONT_RELEASE 106
/// #endif
/// @endcode
///
/// In this example, if the hV_Screen_Font library release is 105, the pre-processor prompts an error message:
/// @code {.cpp}
/// #error Required hV_FONT_RELEASE 106
/// @endcode
///
/// @section Screen Screens
/// @brief This section explains the different screen features exposed by the library.
/// @details Each screen is driven by a controller, and each controller provides different features.
///
/// @n A readable screen allows to get the colour of one specific pixel.
/// @code {.cpp}
/// uint16_t colour;
/// if (myScreen.isReadable()) {
///  colour = myScreen.readPixel(10, 10);
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// If the screen isn't readable, hV_screen::isReadable() is false and hV_screen::readPixel() returns 0.
/// @n The hV_screen::readPixel() function is required by the hV_screen::copyPasteArea() and hV_screen::copyArea() functions.
///
/// @section Storage Storage
/// @brief This section explains the different kinds of storage used used by the library.
/// @details The GUI library saves the initial screen before displaying a dialog box, a menu or a slider, to restore it afterwards.
///
/// A storage can be:
/// * external SRAM
/// * SD-card
///
/// The function hV_screen::isStorage() returns true is a storage is available.
///
/// The storage is required by the hV_screen::copyArea() and hV_screen::pasteArea() functions.
/// * hV_screen::copyArea() copies an area from the screen and saves it to the SRAM or SD-card
/// * hV_screen::pasteArea() reads an area from the SRAM or SD-card and pastes it to the screen
///
/// The MCU SRAM is used for the hV_screen::copyPasteArea() function.
///
/// @section Coordinate Coordinates systems
/// @brief This section explains the rectangle and vector coordinates systems, with the physical and logical screens.
/// @details Two systems of coordinates are used, rectangle and vector coordinates.
///
/// @b Rectangle coordinates include two points P1 and P2.
/// * P1 is a pixel on the top left, with (x1, y1) coordinates.
/// * P2 is a pixel on the bottom right, with (x2, y2) coordinates.
///
/// @image html P1.PDF
/// @image latex P1.PDF width=7cm
///
/// @a Example rectangle (0, 0) - (319, 239)
///
/// @b Vector coordinates include one point P0 and one distance.
/// * P0 is a pixel and the origin, with (x0, y0) coordinates.
/// * The distance (dx, dy) is specified for the horizontal and the vertical axis.
///
/// @image html P2.PDF
/// @image latex P2.PDF width=7cm
///
/// @a Example vector (0, 0) - (320, 240)
/// @n Going from pixel 0 to pixel 319 represents 320 pixels in total
///
/// @details Two systems of coordinates are used, rectangle and vector coordinates.
/// 
/// The coordinates for **physical** screen are consistent with the horizontal and vertical axes from the data-sheets.
/// The coordinates for **logical** screen are defined by the orientation <irg .
///
/// @section Fonts Fonts
/// @brief This section explains how to use the fonts.
/// @details The **basic edition** supplies four extended fonts:
///
/// Font | Name | Size | Bytes | Cumulated
/// --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
/// 0 | Terminal6x8e | 6 x 8 | 1344 | 1344
/// 1 | Terminal8x12e | 8 x 12 | 3584 | 4928
/// 2 | Terminal12x16e | 12 x 16 | 5376 | 10304
/// 3 | Terminal16x24e | 16 x 24 | 10752 | 21056
///
/// The **advanced edition** brings fixed Mono and variable Serif and Sans Serif based on the DejaVu font.
///
/// For both the basic and advanced editions,
///
/// * All the fonts include the extended characters 0x80~0xff corresponding to the ISO-8859-1 fonts page.
/// * To convert UTF-8 strings to ISO-8859-1 strings, use the utf2iso() utility.
///
/// @section Value Values using integer numbers
/// @brief This section explains how values are coded using integer numbers only.
/// @details Using integers only allows to avoid loading the library for real numbers, which requires 6 KB of memory.
///
/// A value are coded using two numbers:
/// * a significand, int32_t number, already multiplied by unit
/// * plus a multiplier, int32_t unit, with default=1, 10 or 100
///
/// value = number / unit = significand / multiplier
///
/// The unit provides the scale of the degrees passed.
///
/// The following calls of the draw() function are equivalent:
///
/// @code{.cpp}
/// draw(90); // = 90 / 1
/// draw(90, 1); // = 90 / 1
/// draw(9000, 100); // = 9000 / 100
/// @endcode
///
/// Functions like cos32x100 and sin32x100 receive and return values multiplied by 100.
/// The unit is set at 100.
/// * int32_t cos32x100(int32_t degreesX100)
/// * int32_t sin32x100(int32_t degreesX100)
///
/// int32_t are used instead of int64_t because some platforms don't manage 64-bit numbers.
///
/// @see
/// * Wikipedia on Floating points and Significand
/// @n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand
///
/// @section Colour Colours
/// @brief This section explains how the colours are coded in 16-bit colours and 8-bits Red-Green-Blue components.
/// @details Colours are coded internally on 16 bits, with 5 bits for red, 6 bits for green and 5 bits for blue, or called RGB565.
///
/// The Red-Green-Blue components are 8-bit sized and 0x00..0xff scaled.
///
/// The **BW e-paper screens** provides 2 basic colours. Combining those 2 basic colours gives an additional shade, totaling 3 colours.
///
/// * white: basic colour
/// * black: basic colour
/// * grey: combined colour, one dot black, another dot white
///
/// The **BWR e-paper screens** provides 3 basic colours. Combining those 3 basic colours gives two additional shades, totaling 6 colours.
///
/// * white: basic colour
/// * black: basic colour
/// * red: basic colour
///
/// and
///
/// * grey: combined colour, one dot black, another dot white
/// * light red: combined colour, one dot red, another dot white
/// * dark red: combined colour, one dot red, another dot black
///
/// @section Port Porting to another SDK
/// When porting the example to another SDK,
/// define main() and call setup() and loop() as follow:
///
/// @code
/// // Prototypes
/// void setup();
/// void loop();
///
/// int main(void)
/// {
/// setup();
///
/// while (1)
/// {
///  loop();
/// }
/// return 0;
/// }
/// @endcode
///

/// @section Configuration Configuration
/// @brief Use hV_Configuration.h to select the configuration for GPIOs and SPI bus.
/// @details Configuration of the options for ePaper EXT3 Basic Library includes 5 steps.
///
/// 1. `CONFIGURATION_OPTION` selects the hardware with pre-defined configurations.
/// 2. Based on `CONFIGURATION_OPTION`, GPIOs are defined.
/// 3. Large screens 9.7 and 12.2 require additional `CSS24_PIN` and `CSS34_PIN`.
/// 4. `FONT_MODE` defines the fonts used, here Terminal for the basic edition.
/// 5. `MAX_FONT_SIZE` sets the number of fonts, maximum 4 for the basic edition.
